Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

Mr. Moon, Mr. Moon, 
Youâ€™re out too soon, 
The sun is still in the sky, 
Go back to bed, 
And cover your head, 
And wait for the day to go by.
