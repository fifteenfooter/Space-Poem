Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

Mr. Moon, Mr. Moon, 
Youâ€™re out too soon, 
The sun is still in the sky, 
Go back to bed, 
And cover your head, 
And wait for the day to go by.

Hey diddle diddle, 
The cat and the fiddle, 
The cow jumped over the moon. 
The little dog laughed 
To see such sport, 
And the dish ran away 
With the spoon.
