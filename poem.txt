The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: 
a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

Hey diddle diddle, 
The cat and the fiddle, 
The cow jumped over the moon. 
The little dog laughed 
To see such sport, 
And the dish ran away 
With the spoon.
